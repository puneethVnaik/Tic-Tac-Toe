# Tic-Tac-Toe Game 🎮  

This project is a **JavaScript-based implementation** of the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**, designed for two players. It demonstrates the use of **DOM manipulation** and **event handling** to create an interactive and enjoyable gaming experience. The game is simple yet engaging, with features that make it both functional and visually appealing.

## ✨ Features  

- **Two-player gameplay**: Alternate turns between “O” and “X.”  
- **Winner Detection**: Predefined winning patterns are checked to declare a winner.  
- **Draw Detection**: Announces a draw if all boxes are filled without a winner.  
- **Reset/New Game**: Allows players to restart the game with ease.  
- **Interactive UI**: Intuitive user interface for seamless gameplay.

## 📚 Motivation  

This project was part of my JavaScript coursework, aimed at strengthening my understanding of core JavaScript concepts such as event listeners, conditional logic, and DOM manipulation. I wanted to create a simple game that is both fun to play and educational for others learning JavaScript.

## 🚀 How It Works  

- **Dynamic Turns**: Players alternate between “O” and “X” on their respective turns.  
- **Winner Detection**: The game checks for matches in predefined winning patterns after every move.  
- **Draw Scenario**: If no winning pattern is detected and all cells are filled, the game declares a draw.  
- **Reset Functionality**: Players can reset the board and start a new game anytime.  
- **User Feedback**: A message is displayed for winners or a draw to enhance the user experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

- **HTML**: For the game layout and structure.  
- **CSS**: For styling the game board and UI elements.  
- **JavaScript**: For game logic, interactivity, and winner detection.
